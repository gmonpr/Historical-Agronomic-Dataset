## Files Included

   **Standardization_&_translation.R**
   
This script includes the following preprocessing steps:
- Standardization of Spanish terms: Ensures consistent terminology across the dataset by homogenizing variations in Spanish-language entries.
- Numerical variable transformations: Applies value ranges and cleaning to selected numerical variables, particularly in cost-related columns to ensure consistent and valid economic data.
- Sheet-specific standardization: These procedures are applied to tables 3 (Harvest), 5 (Irrigation), 6 (Costs and Revenues), and sheet 4 (Agricultural Supplies and Inputs), with targeted cleaning and normalization based on the type of data in each sheet.
- Translation to English: Translates standardized Spanish content into English for broader accessibility and analysis.

 **Dataset_joins.R**

This script demonstrates how to merge multiple sheets from the historical dataset. These sheets are originally provided separately and need to be joined into a single, unified dataset for analysis, according to the type of information required to be worked with.
